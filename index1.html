            <p>New Zealand is located near the centre of the water hemisphere. It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) and the South Island (Te Waipounamu) are separated by Cook Strait, <span>22 kilometres (14 mi)</span> wide at its narrowest point the counrty also has over 700 smaller islands.New Zealand is long and narrow—over <span>1,600 kilometres (990 mi)</span> along its north-north-east axis with a maximum width of <span>400 kilometres (250 mi)</span>—with about <span>15,000 km (9,300 mi)</span> of coastline and a total land area of <span>268,000 square kilometres (103,500 sq mi)</span>. Because of its far-flung outlying islands and long coastline, the country has extensive marine resources. Its exclusive economic zone is one of the largest in the world, covering more than <span>15 times</span> its land area It is the sixth-largest island country by area and the country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps, owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions. The population of New Zealand was <span>5.25 million.</span></p>

            <p>The islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable land to be settled by humans. Between about <span>1280 and 1350</span>, Polynesians began to settle in the islands and then subsequently developed a distinctive Māori culture. <span>In 1642</span>, the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight and record New Zealand. <span>In 1769</span> the British explorer Captain James Cook became the first European to set foot on and map New Zealand. <span>In 1840</span>, representatives of the United Kingdom and Māori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi which paved the way for Britain's declaration of sovereignty later that year and the establishment of the Crown Colony of New Zealand in 1841. Subsequently, a series of conflicts between the colonial government and Māori tribes resulted in the alienation and confiscation of large amounts of Māori land. New Zealand became a dominion <span>in 1907</span>; it gained full statutory independence <span>in 1947</span>, retaining the monarch as head of state. Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of <span>5.25 million</span> is of European descent; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pasifika. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers, with recent broadening of culture arising from increased immigration. The official languages are English, Māori, and New Zealand Sign Language, with the local dialect of English being dominant.</p>
